## How to install

See the [How to install MonoGame.Extended](http://dylanwilson.net/how-to-install-monogame-extended) blog post. 

The package comes with 2 DLLs:

 - MonoGame.Extended.dll
 - MonoGame.Extedded.Content.Pipeline.dll
 
The `MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.dll` is intended to be used with the [Pipeline tool](http://www.monogame.net/documentation/?page=Pipeline). To reference the DLL in the Pipeline tool please edit your `Content.mgcb` file and add a reference to it.

**Remember**: the versions need to match exactly for everything to work.
