# Stryfe RPG

## What is it?
This is a study project I started since I'm stuck at home because of a disease I'm treating. I always wanted to start developing a game but didn't have the time. Now I do. :)

## Which frameworks/libraries do you use?
I'm using **Monogame/XNA** for the game engine, an adapted version of **TiledSharp** (https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp) for map reading and JSON.Net (http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) for JSON operations. I'm not using any database for now, so everything is pure JSON for ease.

## I want to build it and run!
1. Build the TiledSharp project (in this repository)
2. Put the dll inside a "lib" folder in the project's root (not the solution's) - i.e: StryfeRPG/StryfeRPG/lib/TiledSharp.dll
3. Install JSON.Net via NuGet if needed (http://www.newtonsoft.com/json if you need help);
4. Build and run!

I hope that's all it takes for you to run it!

## Are these RPG Maker sprites?
Yes, I'm not an artist and I needed something to test with.
